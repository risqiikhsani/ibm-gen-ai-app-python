# Here's how the code works:

#     Setting up credentials: The credentials needed to access IBM's services are pre-arranged by the Skills Network team, so you don't have to worry about setting them up yourself.

#     Specifying parameters: The code then defines specific parameters for the language model. 'MAX_NEW_TOKENS' sets the limit on the number of words the model can generate in one go. 'TEMPERATURE' adjusts how creative or predictable the generated text is.

#     Setting up Llama 3 model: Next, the LLAMA3 model is set up using a model ID, the provided credentials, chosen parameters, and a project ID.

#     Creating an object for Llama 3: The code creates an object named llm, which is used to interact with the Llama 3 model. A model object, LLAMA3_model, is created using the Model class, which is initialized with a specific model ID, credentials, parameters, and project ID. Then, an instance of WatsonxLLM is created with LLAMA3_model as an argument, initializing the language model hub llm object.

#     Generating and printing response: Finally, 'llm' is used to generate a response to the question, "How to read a book effectively?" The response is then printed out.
